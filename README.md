# FakeNewsDetection
This is a python project on fake news detection. This project of detecting fake news deals with fake and real news. Using Sklearn, we build a TfidfVectorizer on our dataset. Then, we initialize a Passive Aggressive Classifier and fit the model. In the end, the accuracy score and the confusion matrix tell us how well our model works.
