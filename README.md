# FakeNewsDetection
This is a python project on fake news detection. This project of detecting fake news deals with fake and real news. Using Sklearn, we build a TfidfVectorizer on our dataset. Then, we initialize a Passive Aggressive Classifier and fit the model. 

In the end, the accuracy score and the confusion matrix tell us how well our model works. #Project Prerequesites The dataset used in this project is true.csv and fake.csv. 
These data files can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com The environment used to run this project is jupyter notebook.

Fake News Detection

- Developed and implemented a machine learning-based fake news detection system to automatically identify and classify fake news articles and misinformation.

- Utilized natural language processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess and analyze textual data.

- Designed and trained machine learning models, including supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms, for fake news classification.

- Implemented feature engineering and text vectorization to improve model accuracy.

- Achieved an accuracy rate of 90% in detecting fake news articles, contributing to the fight against online misinformation.

- Tools and Technologies: Python, scikit-learn, NLP libraries
